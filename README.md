Overview of the statistical analysis:

1. Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is W. Avy wants more information about temperature and precipitation trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature and precipitation data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

We analized the temperature of June and December between 2010 and 2017 to see if the temperature is high enough for ice cream business.

2. Results:
The screenshots are included as well.

1) June - we analized the temprature and precipitation of June between 2010 and 2017, whcih was 1700 record, average temprature is 74.9 F, standard deviation is 3.25, the lowest temprature is 64 F, and the highest temprature is 85 F. We concluded the June temprature and low precipitation is very good for ice cream buisness in Oahu.

3. Summary:

As we analized the temperature and precipitation trends of June and December before opening the surf shop in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We conclude the temprature trend is very sustainable for the buisness since the average temperature is even over 71 F in June and December, and very steady to maintain the high temprature and low precipitation for the buisness.So, W. Avy should open the surf and ice cream business in Oahu.
